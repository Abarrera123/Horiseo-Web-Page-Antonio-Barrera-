#Horiseo Web page

This website was made for client Horiseo. This revesion of the code was to be able to have a good looking and functioning website. The revision to the start code allows for picture to be displayed on the screen and for items to float on the webpage. 


Steps in editing.
1. My first step was chaning div classes that should have been sematic tags. These tags such as <header>, <section>,<aside>,and <footer>, have been added to HTMl and the following div classes in css have been changed too.I also changed the div class "hero" to "meeting" to help verbaly describe the div describes.

2. My next big change was adding alt tags to all images on the html code. To accomplish this I took the background imagine for the div "meeting" and uploaded the image into the html code. Doing soo i was allowed to add the alt tag for this image. 

3. Lastly I shortened the css code by compiling elements that did the same styling into on line of code.
