# Week-1-Homework

1. My first step was chaning div classes that should have been sematic tags. These tags such as <header>, <section>,<aside>,and <footer>, have been added to HTMl and the following div classes in css have been changed too.I also changed the div class "hero" to "meeting" to help verbaly describe the div describes.

2. My next big change was adding alt tags to all images on the html code. To accomplish this I took the background imagine for the div "meeting" and uploaded the image into the html code. Doing soo i was allowed to add the alt tag for this image. 

3. Lastly I shortened the css code by compiling elements that did the same styling into on line of code.
